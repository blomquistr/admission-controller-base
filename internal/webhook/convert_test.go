 * docs at https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#write-an-admission-webhook-server
 * this is a working and valid example of how to make a Golang webserver that handles admission control requests, and can serve
 * as a model for picking this activity up. This is **not** production ready, this is **not** something you can plug and play.
